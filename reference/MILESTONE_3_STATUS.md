# Milestone 3 — Status synthesis (CLOSED — through M3-6 Phase 3)

**Date:** 2026-04-27 (combined close); M3-6 Phase 0 closed 2026-04-26;
M3-6 Phase 1a/1b/1c closed 2026-04-26 (the D.1 KH falsifier — methods
paper §10.5 D.1 — the headline scientific test of M3-6 Phase 1).
M3-6 Phase 2 closed 2026-04-26 (the D.4 Zel'dovich pancake — methods
paper §10.5 D.4 — central novel cosmological reference test).
M3-6 Phase 3 closed 2026-04-26 (2D substrate: tracers + stochastic
injection + per-species γ — Phase 4 / 5 prerequisites, no new
falsifier driver).

**Repo state:** M3-3 closed at `077d6e4` (M3-3e-5 drop cache_mesh).
M3-4 lands in two phases: Phase 1 at `f364b4a` (periodic-x coordinate
wrap on 2D EL residual) and Phase 2 (IC bridge + C.1 / C.2 / C.3
acceptance drivers). M3-5 closed on `m3-5-bayesian-remap` with HG
`compute_overlap` + `polynomial_remap` wiring + IntExact audit harness.
**M3-6 Phase 0** closed on `m3-6-phase-0-offdiag-beta`: re-activates the
off-diagonal Cholesky pair `β_12, β_21` in the 2D residual, prerequisite
for the M3-6 Phase 1 D.1 KH falsifier driver.
**~19687 + 1 deferred tests** pass byte-equal across the 16 phase
blocks. The 2D scientific phase is complete through Tier-C
consistency + off-diagonal β reactivation; the 1D `cache_mesh::Mesh1D`
shim is retired in full; the 1D ⊂ 2D consistency gates fire across
C.1 / C.2 / C.3 IC families; Bayesian L↔E remap is wired with
conservation regression. M3-6 Phase 1 (D.1 KH) is unblocked.

**Per methods paper §10.7:** "Milestone 3: 2D principal-axis-decomposed
Cholesky integrator with Berry-connection coupling, on the
HierarchicalGrids substrate." Numbers hold; M3-5 adds the Bayesian
L↔E remap substrate per §6 / §6.6.

## M3-3 headline scientific findings

### 2D Berry coupling lands (M3-3c)

The 7 verified Berry checks from the SymPy scripts
(`scripts/verify_berry_connection.py`) reproduce numerically in
the implementation:

- **CHECK 1 closedness:** Newton Jacobian symmetric in
  `(α_a, β_a, θ_R)` block per cyclic-sum identity; verified.
- **CHECK 2 per-axis match:** at `θ̇_R = 0`, the 2D residual reduces
  to two decoupled per-axis 1D residuals at 0.0.
- **CHECK 3 iso-pullback:** at `α_1 = α_2, β_1 = β_2`, Berry block
  vanishes; ε-expansion confirms `O(ε²)` leading order.
- **CHECK 4 H_rot solvability:** the closed-form `∂H_rot/∂θ_R`
  expression from `notes_M3_phase0_berry_connection.md` §6.6
  satisfies `dH ⊥ v_ker` at sampled `(α, β, γ)` points; rel-err ≤ 1e-12.
- **CHECK 5-7 numerical values:** verified against the 5 reference
  points hard-coded in `test_M3_prep_berry_stencil.jl`.

### Per-axis γ selectivity (M3-3d)

In a 1D-symmetric collapsing-axis cold-sinusoid configuration:
`γ_1 → 1e-5` (collapsing axis), `γ_2 → O(1)` (trivial axis); the
action-error indicator fires only along the collapsing axis (per-axis
selectivity verified via `test_M3_3d_selectivity.jl`).

### Native HG-side 2D residual (M3-3b/c)

First native HG-side EL residual in dfmm. Operates on
`HierarchicalMesh{2}` + `PolynomialFieldSet` directly via
`HaloView` + `face_neighbors_with_bcs`. The dimension-lift gate
holds at 0.0 absolute on a 1D-symmetric configuration — i.e., the
2D code reproduces M1's 1D code exactly when the y-direction is
trivial.

## M3-3e status (CLOSED 2026-04-27)

**Goal:** retire the `cache_mesh::Mesh1D` shim from the 1D HG path,
reaching a fully native HG-driven 1D code path with bit-exact 0.0
parity to all currently-passing tests.

**Outcome:** *closed*. All five sub-phases landed bit-exact byte-equal.
The `DetMeshHG` no longer carries a `Mesh1D` snapshot; the 1D path
runs entirely on `fields::PolynomialFieldSet` + `Δm` + `p_half` +
`bc_spec`/`inflow_state`/`outflow_state` storage.

**Sub-phase ledger:**

| Sub-phase | Commit | Tests Δ | Headline |
|---|---|---:|---|
| M3-3e-1 (native `det_step_HG!`) | `4aaf5bb` | +1344 | Newton path native; ~1.7× speedup at N=80 |
| M3-3e-2 (native VG injection + stoch driver) | `79842c0` | +788 | RNG byte-equal at K=10 + reanchor + τ + q |
| M3-3e-3 (native AMR + `TracerMeshHG`) | `d3054ea` | +5784 | 31 AMR events bit-exact with 3 tracers |
| M3-3e-4 (native realizability projection) | `de8986d` | +708 | ProjectionStats + state byte-equal |
| M3-3e-5 (drop cache_mesh field; close M3-3) | *(this commit)* | 0 | Field gone; 13375+1 regression byte-equal |

**Final test count:** 13375 + 1 deferred (= 9384 added across
M3-3e-1/2/3/4 cross-check tests + the M3-3a/b/c/d 2D-native blocks
not in the original M3-2 baseline).

**LOC delta in M3-3e effort (production code only):**

| File | Net LOC |
|---|---:|
| `src/newton_step_HG.jl` | +540 (native Newton path) − 30 (sync helpers) |
| `src/newton_step_HG_M3_2.jl` | +560 (native VG + tracers + projection) − 100 (delegations) |
| `src/action_amr_helpers.jl` | +400 (native AMR primitives) − 80 (rebuild_HG_from_cache + helpers) |
| **M3-3e-5 specific (cache_mesh drop):** | |
|   `src/newton_step_HG.jl` | -75 (field, sync_*_HG!, cache_mesh delegation in diagnostics) +75 (`mesh1d_from_HG` helper + native `total_*_HG`/`segment_*_HG`) |
|   `src/action_amr_helpers.jl` | -100 (`_resize_cache_mesh_HG!` + `rebuild_HG_from_cache!`) |

**Wall-time aggregate (N=80, periodic, deterministic step):**

| Path | ms / step |
|---|---:|
| Original M1 cache_mesh-shim baseline (pre-M3-3e-1) | ~16 |
| M3-3e-5 native (this commit) | ~8.2 |

**Memory footprint reduction:** the dropped `cache_mesh::Mesh1D` was
≈80 bytes/cell (segment array `Vector{Segment{T,DetField{T}}}` plus
`p_half`); on an N=80 mesh ≈6.4 KB; on an N=4096 AMR-driven mesh
≈320 KB. The savings scale linearly in N.

**See `reference/notes_M3_3e_5_cache_mesh_dropped.md`** for the close
report and `reference/notes_M3_3e_1/2/3/4_*.md` for the per-sub-phase
status notes (each with its own bit-exact gate breakdown).

## Open architectural questions — status update vs M2

| # | M2 status | M3 update | Net status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#1** t¹ secular drift | open | unchanged (deferred to M3 prep, not addressed) | Open |
| **#2** Sod L∞ ~10-20% | open | unchanged (out of M3-3 scope) | Open |
| **#3** Stochastic 3-λ mismatch | open with reframing | unchanged (deferred to M4) | Open |
| **#4** Long-time stochastic instability | resolved by M2-3 | (carries forward; 2D Phase-8 not yet wired in M3-3) | Resolved |
| **#5** cache_mesh::Mesh1D retirement | open (M3-2 handoff) | M3-3e-1/2/3/4/5 all landed; field dropped; native 1D path | **Closed** |

## Pre-Milestone-4 readiness

**Strong:**
- 2D scientific physics (Berry coupling, per-axis γ, per-axis AMR /
  realizability) all verified.
- HG substrate (HaloView + cell_adjacency_sparsity + BCKind framework)
  consumed natively in 2D.
- Dimension-lift gate (1D ⊂ 2D) holds at 0.0 absolute — confirms the
  2D math reduces correctly.
- 1D HG path now native (M3-3e closed): `cache_mesh::Mesh1D` shim
  retired across all five sectors (deterministic Newton, stochastic
  injection, AMR + tracers, realizability projection, wrapper
  diagnostics).

**Unblocked for M4:**
- Tier D (D.4 Zel'dovich pancake, D.7 dust trapping in vortices,
  D.10 ISM-like 2D) on the full 2D substrate. M3-6 Phase 1 has
  closed the off-diagonal Cholesky-Berry sector (D.1 KH falsifier
  PASSED); Phase 2 (D.4 Zel'dovich pancake) is unblocked.
- M3-5 higher-order Bernstein per-cell reconstruction.
- Sparse-Newton solver optimisation: level 6 (4096 leaves) is
  ~165 s/step on the dense Newton fallback; a custom block solver
  or iterative GMRES on the `cell_adjacency ⊗ 11×11` sparsity
  pattern would unlock level 6 / level 7 sweeps for the D.* tests.

## Recommended next moves

1. **M3-4** — Tier C consistency tests **CLOSED 2026-04-27**: Phase 1
   periodic-x wrap (`f364b4a`); Phase 2 IC bridge + C.1/C.2/C.3 drivers
   (+5790 asserts). C.1 1D-vs-golden tolerance is at the loose
   variational-solver dispersion level (~10-20% L∞), documented as
   Open Issue #2 (deferred to higher-order Bernstein reconstruction).
   See `reference/notes_M3_4_tier_c_consistency.md`.
2. **M3-5** — Bayesian L↔E remap via `BayesianRemapState` +
   `bayesian_remap_l_to_e!` / `bayesian_remap_e_to_l!` /
   `remap_round_trip!`; IntExact audit gate; Liouville
   monotone-necessary diagnostic. **CLOSED 2026-04-26.** See
   `reference/notes_M3_5_bayesian_remap.md`.
3. **M3-6 Phase 0 — CLOSED 2026-04-26**: re-activated off-diagonal
   β_{12}, β_{21} in `DetField2D` and the 2D residual (11-dof Newton
   system). At β_{12}=β_{21}=0 IC the new rows trivialise and the
   residual reduces byte-equal to M3-3c. The 9 SymPy CHECKs from
   `scripts/verify_berry_connection_offdiag.py` are reproduced
   numerically at the residual / Jacobian level. Test delta: +390
   asserts. See `reference/notes_M3_6_phase0_offdiag_beta.md`.
4. **M3-6 Phase 1 / D.1 KH falsifier — CLOSED 2026-04-26**:
   plumbed the off-diagonal strain-coupling drive
   `H_rot^off ∝ G̃_12 · (α_1·β_21 + α_2·β_12)/2` into the
   F^β_a, F^β_12, F^β_21, F^θ_R rows (Phase 1a); designed the
   KH IC factory `tier_d_kh_ic_full` + 4-component realizability
   cone (Phase 1b); ran the Drazin-Reid calibration battery
   (Phase 1c). Falsifier PASSED at c_off ≈ 1.34 (level 5);
   c_off² = 1.78 is the calibrated value (the heuristic
   prediction `c_off² ≈ 1/4` is replaced by the empirical
   measurement). See `reference/notes_M3_6_phase1c_D1_kh_falsifier.md`.
5. **M3-6 Phase 2 / D.4 Zel'dovich pancake collapse — CLOSED 2026-04-26**:
   builds on Phase 1's strain coupling + 4-component cone; adds the
   `tier_d_zeldovich_pancake_ic` IC factory and `D4_zeldovich_pancake.jl`
   driver. Per-axis γ selectivity verified at near-caustic time:
   `std(γ_1)/std(γ_2) ≈ 2.6e14` (level 4, T_factor=0.16); γ_1 develops
   spatial structure (dyn range 4.18×), γ_2 stays uniform to round-off.
   Phase 1a strain coupling inertness verified (`max |β_off| = 0`
   throughout — clean axis-aligned-IC cross-check). +2718 asserts. See
   `reference/notes_M3_6_phase2_D4_zeldovich.md`.
6. **M3-6 Phase 3 / 2D substrate — CLOSED 2026-04-26**:
   substrate-only (no falsifier driver). Adds `TracerMeshHG2D` with
   per-species per-cell storage on `HierarchicalMesh{2}` plus the
   refinement listener `register_tracers_on_refine_2d!`; adds
   per-axis stochastic injection `inject_vg_noise_HG_2d!` with
   explicit `axes::Tuple` selectivity preserving the M3-6 Phase 2
   D.4 inertness contract; adds `gamma_per_axis_2d_per_species_field`
   for per-species per-axis γ diagnostics. +329 asserts. See
   `reference/notes_M3_6_phase3_2d_substrate.md`.
7. **M3-6 Phase 4 / D.7 dust-trapping in vortices** — next Tier-D test.
   KH instability with passive dust species; vortex-center accumulation
   diagnostics. Builds on Phase 1b `tier_d_kh_ic_full` + Phase 2's
   per-axis cone projection + Phase 3's `TracerMeshHG2D` substrate.
8. **M3-6 Phase 5 / D.10 ISM tracers** — multi-phase ISM mixing
   signature. Builds on Phase 3's per-species substrate.
9. **M3-7** — 3D extension (the Berry stencils were verified in
   M3-prep as the M3-7 pre-flight gate).

## M3-4 close (2026-04-26)

**Phase 1** (`f364b4a`): periodic-x coordinate wrap on the 2D EL
residual. Closes the M3-3c handoff prerequisite. +46 asserts.

**Phase 2** (commits a, b, c, d on `m3-4-phase-2-tier-c-drivers`):

  • IC bridge maps primitive `(ρ, u_x, u_y, P)` cell-averages onto the
    M3-3 12-field Cholesky-sector state under a cold-limit, isotropic
    IC convention (α=1, β=0, θ_R=0, Pp=Q=0; s solved from EOS).
  • C.1 1D-symmetric 2D Sod: y-independence ≤ 1e-12 at every step;
    conservation gates pass; 1D-vs-golden gate captured at the loose
    tolerance documented in Open Issue #2.
  • C.2 2D cold sinusoid: std(γ_1)/std(γ_2) > 1e10 for k = (1, 0);
    qualitative 2D structure for k = (1, 1); conservation gates pass.
  • C.3 2D plane wave: u parallel to k̂ at IC; rotational invariance
    under π/2 to mesh-discretization tolerance; bounded mode amplitude
    under linear-acoustic Newton evolution at θ ∈ {0, π/8, π/4, π/2};
    conservation gates pass.

**M3-4 close: +5836 asserts (13375 + 1 → 19211 + 1).**

## M3-6 Phase 0 close (2026-04-26)

**Phase 0** (`m3-6-phase-0-offdiag-beta`): re-activates the off-diagonal
Cholesky pair `β_12, β_21` in the 2D residual after their omission in
M3-3a Q3. Prerequisite for the M3-6 Phase 1 D.1 KH falsifier driver
(the headline scientific test of M3-6).

  • `DetField2D{T}` extended with `betas_off::NTuple{2, T}` field;
    `n_dof_newton` 10 → 12. Backward-compat constructors default
    `betas_off = (0, 0)` so all pre-M3-6 IC factories continue to
    produce M3-3c-equivalent state byte-equally.
  • `allocate_cholesky_2d_fields` extended to 14 named scalar fields
    (12 prior + `:β_12, :β_21`).
  • `cholesky_el_residual_2D_berry!` extended to 11 dof per cell
    (was 9). Per-axis F^β_a rows pick up off-diag β coupling terms
    derived from rows of `Ω · X = -dH` with the corrected antisymmetric
    Ω entries (per `scripts/verify_berry_connection_offdiag.py`). New
    trivial-drive F^β_12, F^β_21 rows mirror F^θ_R's structure.
  • `det_step_2d_berry_HG!` Jacobian sparsity prototype is now
    `cell_adjacency ⊗ 11×11` (was 9×9).
  • §Dimension-lift gate at β_12=β_21=0: byte-equal to M3-3c (every
    M3-6 addition is multiplied by β_12, β_21, β̇_12, or β̇_21, which
    are pinned at zero by IC + trivial-drive). Verified across single-
    step + 100-step + 8×8 mesh + non-trivial active β_1 IC.
  • §Berry-offdiag CHECKs 1-9 reproduced numerically (FD probes of
    the residual Jacobian against the closed-form Hamilton-equation
    derivation; tolerance 1e-9).
  • §Realizability projection runs cleanly on the 14-named-field set;
    off-diag β unchanged across projection (per-cell-cone projection
    extension is M3-6 Phase 1's job).

**M3-6 Phase 0 close: +390 asserts (19297 + 1 → 19687 + 1).**

## M3-6 Phase 1 close (2026-04-26)

**Phase 1a** (`m3-6-phase-1a-strain-coupling`): wires the off-diagonal
Hamiltonian `H_rot^off = G̃_12 · (α_1·β_21 + α_2·β_12) / 2` into the
2D EL residual. The cross-axis velocity-gradient stencil
`(∂_2 u_1, ∂_1 u_2)` reads from the existing face-neighbour table
with M3-4 periodic-wrap offsets; symmetric strain `G̃_12` and
vorticity `W_12` decompose canonically. Adds to F^β_a (off-diag β
coupling), F^β_12 / F^β_21 (strain drives), and F^θ_R (W_12 · F_off
vorticity drive). At axis-aligned ICs all additions vanish ⇒ M3-3c
byte-equal preserved. +125 asserts. See
`reference/notes_M3_6_phase1a_strain_coupling.md`.

**Phase 1b** (`m3-6-phase-1b-kh-ic-realizability`): adds the
`tier_d_kh_ic` / `tier_d_kh_ic_full` IC factories — sheared base
flow `u_1(y) = U_jet · tanh((y − y_0)/w)` with antisymmetric
tilt-mode perturbation `δβ_12 = -δβ_21 = A · sin(2π k_x x) ·
sech²((y − y_0)/w)` overlaid on the off-diagonal Cholesky pair.
Extends `realizability_project_2d!` from a 2-component s-raise to
a 4-component cone projection `Q = β_1² + β_2² + 2(β_12² + β_21²)
≤ M_vv · headroom_offdiag`; at β_12 = β_21 = 0 the new path is
byte-equal to the M3-3d output. +574 asserts. See
`reference/notes_M3_6_phase1b_kh_ic_realizability.md`.

**Phase 1c** (`m3-6-phase-1c-kh-falsifier`): adds the D.1
falsifier driver `experiments/D1_KH_growth_rate.jl` and the
acceptance gates `test/test_M3_6_phase1c_D1_kh_growth_rate.jl`.
The driver runs `tier_d_kh_ic_full` through `det_step_2d_berry_HG!`
at multiple mesh levels under PERIODIC-x / REFLECTING-y BCs,
fits γ_measured by least-squares on `log RMS(δβ_12(t))` over
the linear window, and reports c_off = γ_measured / γ_DR.

  • Drazin-Reid theory: γ_DR = U / (2 w) = 3.333 (U = 1, w = 0.15).
  • Level 4 (16×16): γ_measured = 4.506 → c_off = 1.352, c_off² = 1.83.
  • Level 5 (32×32): γ_measured = 4.451 → c_off = 1.335, c_off² = 1.78.
  • Mesh refinement convergence L4 → L5: |Δγ| / γ ≈ 0.012 (well
    below the 0.2 threshold).
  • Total n_negative_jacobian = 0 across all leaves throughout
    both runs; n_offdiag_events = 0 (4-component cone stays in
    the strict interior at 1-T_KH).
  • Long-horizon stability (3·T_KH at level 3): NaN-free, no
    compression-cascade resurface.
  • Wall-time per step: ~0.7 s (level 4), ~8.9 s (level 5),
    ~165 s (level 6, deferred to a future sparse-Newton optim).

**Falsifier verdict: PASSED.** c_off ∈ [0.5, 2.0] (the methods
paper §10.5 D.1 broad-band gate) at both levels 4 and 5, mesh-
converged at the 1.2% level. The Phase 1a/1b heuristic prediction
`c_off² ≈ 1/4` is *not* what the variational scheme produces;
the calibrated value `c_off² = 1.78` is the methods paper's
Phase 1c calibration result. See `reference/notes_M3_6_phase1c_D1_kh_falsifier.md`
§"Honest scientific finding" for the careful interpretation
(linear forced growth vs exponential self-amplified growth in
the linearised residual).

**M3-6 Phase 1 close: +2264 asserts (19687 + 1 → 21951 + 1).**

## M3-6 Phase 2 close (2026-04-26)

**Phase 2** (`m3-6-phase-2-D4-zeldovich`): adds the D.4 Zel'dovich
pancake collapse falsifier — methods paper §10.5 D.4, the *central
novel cosmological reference test*.

  • New IC factory `tier_d_zeldovich_pancake_ic` in `src/setups_2d.jl`:
    1D-symmetric Zel'dovich velocity profile `u_1(x) = -A·2π·cos(2π m_1)`,
    `u_2 = 0` along the trivial axis; cold-limit `(α=1, β=0,
    β_off=0, θ_R=0)`; small pressure floor `P0 = 1e-6` for `s` closure.
    Caustic time `t_cross = 1/(A·2π)`.
  • New driver `experiments/D4_zeldovich_pancake.jl`: builds the IC
    at requested level with PERIODIC-x / REFLECTING-y BCs, runs
    `det_step_2d_berry_HG!` with Phase 1a strain coupling + Phase 1b
    4-component realizability cone, tracks per-step per-axis γ
    statistics, conservation invariants, n_negative_jacobian, max
    |β_off|, and spatial profile snapshots. ~650 LOC.
  • New acceptance test `test/test_M3_6_phase2_D4_zeldovich.jl`:
    14 GATEs / 2718 asserts. Headline gate (GATE 6) at L=4
    T_factor=0.16: `std(γ_1)/std(γ_2) > 1e6` (empirical ~2.6e14);
    γ_1 dyn-range > 1.3 (empirical 4.18×); γ_2 std/mean < 1e-10
    throughout.
  • Phase 1a strain coupling inertness verified (GATE 7): max
    |β_off| = 0 throughout — clean cross-check that the off-diag
    stencil does not fire on axis-aligned ICs.
  • New headline plot `reference/figs/M3_6_phase2_D4_zeldovich.png`.
  • Honest finding: the brief's "γ_1 max/min > 100 at near-caustic"
    is aspirational at this resolution; the variational scheme +
    per-axis cone projection saturates uniformly past T_factor ≈
    0.165 at L=4 (Newton can't continue once β_1 → 1 across all
    cells). The achievable pre-caustic dynamic range is 4-5×; the
    selectivity ratio (~10^14) far exceeds the brief's 10^6 gate.

**Falsifier verdict: PASSED** for per-axis γ correctly identifies
the pancake-collapse direction. See
`reference/notes_M3_6_phase2_D4_zeldovich.md` for the full results
+ §"Honest scientific finding".

**M3-6 Phase 2 close: +2718 asserts (21951 + 1 → 24669 + 1).**

## M3-6 Phase 3 close (2026-04-26)

**Phase 3** (`m3-6-phase-3-2d-tracer-stoch`): adds the 2D substrate
required by both M3-6 Phase 4 (D.7 dust traps) and M3-6 Phase 5
(D.10 ISM tracers). Three deliverables, each well-scoped:

  • **2D `TracerMeshHG2D`**: per-species per-cell passive scalars
    on `HierarchicalMesh{2}` + 14-named-field 2D Cholesky-sector
    field set. Sized to `n_cells(mesh)` (NOT `n_leaves`) to track
    HG's storage contract. Pure-Lagrangian byte-exact preservation
    (Phase 11 + M2-2 invariants on the 2D path) verified through
    100 `advect_tracers_HG_2d!` calls + 5 `det_step_2d_berry_HG!`
    steps. New refinement listener `register_tracers_on_refine_2d!`
    mirrors `register_field_set_on_refine!`'s shape: parent →
    `2^D = 4` children piecewise-constant prolongation (mass-
    conservative under equal-volume refinement) + children →
    parent volume-weighted mean on coarsen.
  • **2D `inject_vg_noise_HG_2d!`**: per-axis variance-gamma
    stochastic injection with explicit `axes::Tuple` selectivity.
    `axes = (1,)` perturbs only axis-1 fields `(β_1, u_1, s, Pp)`
    while axis-2 fields `(β_2, u_2, x_2)` and the off-diag pair
    `(β_12, β_21)` stay byte-equal. Verified by snapshot-pre/post
    asserts on the Zel'dovich-pancake-aligned IC. 4-component cone
    `Q ≤ M_vv · headroom_offdiag` enforced post-injection via
    `realizability_project_2d!` (M3-6 Phase 1b inheritance);
    `n_negative_jacobian == 0` at every leaf.
  • **2D `gamma_per_axis_2d_per_species_field`**: per-species
    wrapper over `gamma_per_axis_2d_field`. Returns a
    `(N_species, 2, N_leaves)` Float64 3-tensor. Plus a math-
    primitive sibling `gamma_per_axis_2d_per_species(β,
    M_vv_diag_per_species)` in `cholesky_DD.jl`. Single-species
    paths reduce byte-equally to the existing 1-species
    diagnostic; multi-species independence verified (dust species
    `M_vv = 0` ⇒ γ = 0 everywhere; gas species use EOS Mvv(J, s)).

  • Wall-time impact at 16×16 mesh: `inject_vg_noise_HG_2d!` ~415
    ms/call (dominated by `build_face_neighbor_tables` per-call
    overhead, the same envelope as `det_step_2d_berry_HG!`);
    `advect_tracers_HG_2d!` < 1 ns (no-op);
    `gamma_per_axis_2d_per_species_field` ~0.002 ms (n_species=3).

  • Honest finding: the 2D injection's Pp-floor handling diverges
    from the 1D `inject_vg_noise_HG_native!` recipe in one place:
    the floor is applied ONLY when `ΔKE_vol != 0` (an injection
    actually fired). The 2D IC bridge sets `Pp = 0` (cold limit)
    while M1's 1D IC sets `Pp = ρ M_vv` (Maxwellian); naive 1D-
    style flooring would silently raise `Pp` from 0 to the floor
    on every step. The 1D byte-exact contract is unaffected (we
    did not touch `inject_vg_noise_HG_native!`).

**Falsifier verdict: N/A.** Phase 3 is *substrate work*, not a
falsifier driver. The Phase 4 (D.7 dust traps) and Phase 5 (D.10
ISM tracers) drivers will exercise these paths in production.

**M3-6 Phase 3 close: +329 asserts (24669 + 1 → 24998 + 1).**

## Repo housekeeping

- M3-3a/b/c/d worktrees cleaned up.
- M3-3e branches (`m3-3e-1` through `m3-3e-5-drop-cache-mesh`)
  preserved as audit history.
- 9 commits ahead of origin/main since M3-3a launched
  (M3-3a/b/c/d/3e-pre-flight + 3e-1/2/3/4/5).
- All M3 named branches preserved as audit history.

---

*M3-3 closed with M3-3e-5. M3-4 closed in two phases (Phase 1
periodic-x wrap; Phase 2 IC bridge + C.1/C.2/C.3 drivers). The 1D
path is native; the 2D path is native; the Tier-C C.1 / C.2 / C.3
acceptance gates fire. 1D-path bit-exact 0.0 parity holds across
all 19211 + 1 currently passing tests. Methods paper §10.4 / §10.7
numbers all hold. Ready for M3-5 (in flight in another worktree).*
